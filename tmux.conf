# Hints:
# set is short for set-option
# setw is short for set-window-option 
# -g is used to set it globally

#H Hostname of local host
#h Hostname of local host without the domain name
#F Current window flag
#I Current window index
#P Current pane index
#S Current session name
#T Current window title
#W Current window name
## A literal #
#(shell-command) First line of the shell command’s output
#[attributes] Color or attribute change
set -g status-left "#[bg=white,fg=black]S:#S >   "


# enable activity alerts
# The monitor-activity on command highlights the window name in the status line when there’s activity in that window. 
# The visual-activity on line tells tmux to show a message in the status line as well
setw -g monitor-activity off
set -g visual-activity off

# Update the status line every sixty seconds
# tmux refreshes the status line every 15 seconds
# set -g status-interval 15

# Change the Prefix Key from C-b to C-x
# set -g prefix C-x
# unbind C-b
# Ensure that we can send Ctrl-A to other apps
# We remapped Ctrl-x as the Prefix, but programs such as Vim, Emacs, and even the regular Bash shell also use that combination. 
# You’ll probably want to configure tmux to send that command through when you need it
# After reloading the configuration file, you can send Ctrl-x to an application running within tmux simply by pressing Ctrl-x twice.
# bind C-x send-prefix

# splitting panes with | and -
# bind | split-window -h
# bind - split-window -v

# moving between panes with Prefix h,j,k,l,the default arrow direction still works
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# Prefix H, Prefix J, Prefix K, and Prefix L to change the size of the panes. 
# bind H resize-pane -L 5
# bind J resize-pane -D 5
# bind K resize-pane -U 5
# bind L resize-pane -R 5


#  By default, the window list is left-aligned
# Center the window list in the status line
# set -g status-justify centre

# Reload the file with Prefix r
# Aslo,you can bind a key to a series of commands by separating the commands with the \; character combination.
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "config file ~/.tmux.conf Reloaded!"

#clear history
bind -n C-k clear-history

# bind key for synchronized-panes
bind b set-window-option synchronize-panes


# Using the bind command with the -n prefix tells tmux that the keybinding doesn’t require pressing the prefix. For example,
# bind-key -n C-r source-file ~/.tmux.conf
# would make Ctrl-r reload the configuration file. 
# Unfortunately, this would completely disable that key combination in any application that’s running in a tmux session, so you’ll want to use this with care.

# Set the base index for windows to 1 instead of 0
