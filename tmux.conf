# Hints:
# set is short for set-option
# setw is short for set-window-option 
# -g is used to set it globally

#H Hostname of local host
#h Hostname of local host without the domain name
#F Current window flag
#I Current window index
#P Current pane index
#S Current session name
#T Current window title
#W Current window name
## A literal #
#(shell-command) First line of the shell command’s output
#[attributes] Color or attribute change
set -g status-left "#[bg=white,fg=black]S:#S >   "


# enable activity alerts
# The monitor-activity on command highlights the window name in the status line when there’s activity in that window. 
# The visual-activity on line tells tmux to show a message in the status line as well

# Change the Prefix Key from C-b to C-x
set -g prefix C-x

# Ensure that we can send Ctrl-x to other apps
# We remapped Ctrl-x as the Prefix, but programs such as Vim, Emacs, and even the regular Bash shell also use that combination. 
# You’ll probably want to configure tmux to send that command through when you need it
# After reloading the configuration file, you can send Ctrl-x to an application running within tmux simply by pressing Ctrl-x twice.

# Using the bind command with the -n prefix tells tmux that the keybinding doesn’t require pressing the prefix. For example,
# bind-key -n C-r source-file ~/.tmux.conf
# would make Ctrl-r reload the configuration file. 
# Unfortunately, this would completely disable that key combination in any application that’s running in a tmux session, so you’ll want to use this with care.

# Search
# prefix + / - regex search (strings work too)
# Example search entries:
# 
# foo - searches for string foo
# [0-9]+ - regex search for numbers
# Grep is used for searching. Searches are case insensitive.
# 
# Predefined searches
# prefix + ctrl-f - simple file search
# prefix + ctrl-g - jumping over git status files (best used after git status command)
# prefix + alt-h - jumping over SHA-1/SHA-256 hashes (best used after git log command)
# prefix + ctrl-u - url search (http, ftp and git urls)
# prefix + ctrl-d - number search (mnemonic d, as digit)
# prefix + alt-i - ip address search
# These start "copycat mode" and jump to first match.
# 
# "Copycat mode" bindings
# These are enabled when you search with copycat:
# 
# n - jumps to the next match
# N - jumps to the previous match
# 
# To copy a highlighted match:
# 
# Enter - if you're using Tmux vi mode
# ctrl-w or alt-w - if you're using Tmux emacs mode
# Copying a highlighted match will take you "out" of copycat mode. Paste with prefix + ] (this is Tmux default paste).
